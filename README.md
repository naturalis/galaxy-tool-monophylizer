# Monophylizer

Galaxy tool for assessing monophyly in barcode gene trees. This tool takes an input gene tree with multiple species each having multiple haplotypes and assesses the extent and nature of the entanglement of the tips. For each species, it reports whether all the tips for that species are monophyletic with respect to each other or whether they are entangled with another species and, if so, whether this is polyphyly or paraphyly. The output is a tab-separated table.

This tool was developed and used in a broad survey of barcode gene trees from European Lepidoptera. The survey showed that poly- and paraphyly are caused by a variety of mechanisms, including the influence of various tree-building algorithms, misidentification of specimens, and biological processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. As such, it can be used both for studying biology and for assessing data quality and analytical methods.
